## Why?
During my experience with scorekeeping on mobile apps, I often encountered frustrating interruptions in the form of advertisements while trying to count scores. These interruptions could sometimes last for 5-10 seconds. To address this issue, I developed this Progressive Web App (PWA) in about an hour, offering an ad-free and seamless counting experience! It's hosted for free on [scoreboard.paultje52.me](https://scoreboard.paultje52.me).
